# Normalized Difference Vegeation Index
I'll advice you gather some knowledge on The field
This is the code for the "How to Do the project the Right Way"


## Overview of the code and everything

I'm using a small dataset of student test scores and the amount of hours they studied.
Intuitively, there must be a relationship right(The more the test score and study time, the higher the chances of them passing
The more you study, the better your test scores should be. 
We're going to use  to prove this relationship.

## Dependencies

* numpy for numerical compuation esp in the partial derivatives

Python 3 is a preferable one for this


## Usage

Just run ``python3 my_demo.py`` to see the results in your terminal and command line(Linux/Mac) and cmd for windows:

   ```
 
Starting gradient descent at b = 0, m = 0, error = 5565.107834483211
Running...
After 1000 iterations b = 0.08893651993741346, m = 1.4777440851894448, error = 112.61481011613473

```
